            <h1>Tone La Huruma</h1>
            <p>Access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation is necessary for health, income generation, poverty alleviation, gender equality, human rights and personal dignity. Yet in Tanzania, almost one out of every two people has no access to safe water supply. Due to vast geographic dispersion, rural Tanzanians often spend their valuable time to travel long distances to fetch water. </p>
            <p>Islamic Help has been working in Tanzania since 2009 and our efforts are bringing improvements to the wellbeing of families by providing water solutions in the form of water pumps, wells, rain (roof) harvesting, solar powered boreholes, establishment of harims and water conservation and hygiene education. To date Islamic Help Tanzania has built 115 wells in various districts in and around Dar Es Salaam.  Implementation of our initiatives will contribute towards the eradication of poverty and contribute towards meeting target 10 of the Millennium Development Goal (MDGs) â€“ Halving the proportion of people without access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015.</p>
            <h3>Selected Districts for Intervention</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Mafia</li>
                <li>Mkuranga</li>
                <li>Kisarawe</li>
                <li>Pangani</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Solutions</h3>
            <p>The intervention the project offers suggest short and long terms plans as solutions:</p>
                <p>The short term intervention is to provide an adequate supply of water in order to salvage communities from becoming climate change refugees.  The long term solution is to promote environmental regeneration and advocacy; it is envisaged the project is a long term investment and a seed funding for large scale environmental regeneration in order to sustain the next generation of communities.</p>

            <h3>Operational Impact</h3>
            <p>The water supply gaps for the villages in the four respective districts have addressed with more tanks required in Kisarawe district. The impacts of the boreholes, large and medium scale rainwater harvesting community and household, wells drilling are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Quality water supplied for each of the water villages.</li>
                <li>Disease and more so water borne disease and water contamination is reduced.</li>
                <li>School attendances improved and with the related direct impact being long queuing time cut.</li>
                <li>Valuable community time now allocated for other economic and social activities.</li>
                <li>Improved well-being of the community thus the communities now use their time usefully in doing other important chores.</li>
                <li>Communities co-operate in as much that they ensure that the wells and tanks are well attended to.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Sustainability</h3>
            <p>In order to formulate a sustainable project, Islamic Help Tanzania have incorporated the following measures in the project plan:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Local community participation in designing and implementation phases in order to create the sense of ownership, leading to greater care of the water supply facilities.</li>
                <li>Locals are sensitised on water conservation and maintenance of water facilities, hence creating more likelihood of better care of these facilities.</li>
                <li>The local community contribute by paying an amount of 300Tsh for a 20 litre bucket where the money contributes towards environmental regeneration.</li>
                <li>The environment will be conserved over time. </li>
            </ol>
