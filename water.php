            <h1>Water Projects</h1>
            <p>Access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation is necessary for health, income generation, poverty alleviation, gender equality, human rights and personal dignity. Yet in Tanzania, almost one out of every two people has no access to safe water supply. Due to vast geographic dispersion, rural Tanzanians often spend their valuable time to travel long distances to fetch water. </p>
            <p>Islamic Help has been working in Tanzania since 2009 and our efforts are bringing improvements in the wellbeing of families by providing water solutions in the form of water pumps, wells, rain (roof) harvesting, water conservation and hygiene education. Implementation of our initiatives will contribute towards the eradication of poverty and contribute towards meeting target 10 of the Millennium Development Goal (MDGs) – Halving the proportion of people without access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015.</p> 
            <h3>Selected Districts for Intervention</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Mafia</li>
                <li>Mkuranga</li>
                <li>Kisarawe</li>
                <li>Pangani</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Solutions</h3>
            <p>The vulnerable communities suggest short and long term plans as solutions. The short term intervention is to provide adequate supply of water and the long term solution of environmental regeneration and advocacy.</p>
            <p>Therefore the short term project of supplying water is an entry point to salvage the communities from becoming climate change refugees. Hence it is envisaged this project is a long term investment and a seed funding for large scale environmental regeneration project to sustain the next generation of these communities.</p>

                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Operational Impact</h3>
            <p>The water supply gaps for the villages in the four respective districts have addressed with more tanks required for Chole and Kwala in Kisarawe district. The impacts of the boreholes, large and medium scale rainwater harvesting community and household, wells drilling are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Quality water supplied for each of the water villages.</li>
                <li>Disease and more so water borne disease and water contamination is reduced.</li>
                <li>School attendances improved and with the related direct impact being long queuing time cut.</li>
                <li>Valuable community time now allocated for other economic and social activities.</li>
                <li>Improved well-being of the community thus the communities now use their time usefully in doing other important chores.</li>
                <li>Communities co-operate in as much that they ensure that the wells and tanks are well attended to.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Sustainability</h3>
            <p>In order to make the project sustainable, following measures are incorporated in the project plan:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Local community participation in designing and implementation phases in order to create the sense of ownership, leading to greater care of the water supply facilities.</li>
                <li>Locals are sensitised on water conservation and maintenance of water facilities, hence creating more likelihood of better care of these facilities.</li>
                <li>The local community will contribute by paying an amount of 300Tsh for a 20 litre bucket as opposed to 700Tsh paid before they pay the same amount in most cases. The difference is the extra money goes to environmental regeneration.</li>
                <li>The environment will be conserved over time. </li>
            </ol>
