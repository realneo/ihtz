            <h1>Orphan Care</h1>
            <p>Tanzania is currently one of the most severely stricken countries with an orphan population of 1.3 million children which continues to grow at an alarming pace. To go through childhood without the protection and care of a parent or guardian is one of the most unimaginably difficult things. Orphan children are often left with no option but to fend for them-selves or be dependent on the generosity of sponsors near and far. Many, however, are left vulnerable to exploitation.</p>
            <h3>Orphan Care</h3>
            <p>Islamic Help's Orphan Sponsorship Scheme supports the most vulnerable of orphans – those with little support, caught in the throes of conflict and instability. We support orphans living in orphanages and those that live with family members or siblings.</p>
            <p>Islamic Help Tanzania’s orphan care scheme supports the most vulnerable of orphans – those with very little support, caught in the throes of conflict and instability. We support orphans living in orphanages and those that live with family members or siblings.</p> 
            <p>Our orphan care program is continuously growing: Since 2010, the number of orphan children under Islamic Help’s care has grown from 100 to now 518 in different locations of Tanzania. This program has ensured continuity of the children’s education, ensured sufficient nutritional access to the children, proper health care, ensured physical, metal and social growth and also savings for the child and his/her guardian.</p> 
            <p>Our Orphan Sponsorship Scheme provides a comprehensive package of support to meet the needs of each individual child sponsored, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong><span class="red">Shelter</span></strong> – whether living with relatives, friends or in an orphanage we ensure that the orphan sponsored has a roof over their head and the security and protection that they deserve</li>
                <li><strong><span class="red">Food</span></strong> – we ensure that the child's nutritional needs are met.</li>
                <li><strong><span class="red">Education</span></strong> – we ensure that the child has access to education, attends school or classes so as to enable them to read, write and access opportunities for future prosperity.</li>
                <li><strong><span class="red">Healthcare</span></strong> – we ensure that the sponsored child has access to healthcare and medication according to their needs.</li>
                <li><strong><span class="red">Welfare</span></strong> – we ensure that the environment in which the sponsored child lives is protective and nurturing and are in regular contact with their careers or guardians. Any issues affecting their general wellbeing are identified and dealt with. At all times we seek to ensure that their dignity and self-worth are honoured.</li>
            </ul>	
            
            <p>Our Orphan Sponsorship Scheme is a life changing opportunity for vulnerable orphans. For just <span class="red"><strong>2600 Tshs</strong></span> a day you can change a child's life forever.</p>
