            <h1>Somalia Droughts 2011</h1>

            <p>Dobley is a border town of Afmadow district, southern Somalia. The district has an estimated population of 50,000 to 100,000 households and has one of the highest poverty levels with an index of 60 percent. Dobley town was under control of TFG forces who are visible with heavy machinery guns loaded on the pickup trucks. The town had one general hospital which was not functioning fully with limited supplies of medicine; only MCH was active. There were several mosques in the town and a former school then empty buildings. The district is an arid one, with an average rainfall of less than 200 mm per year. The rainfall is erratic making the entire district susceptible to draught. But the deadly combination of the livestock disease, Rift Valley Fever, and persistent draught killed tens of hundreds of livestock herds in 2011 eliminating the mainstay of the bulk of the population. This subsequently caused a massive movement of nomads into towns without any source of income.</p>

            <p>In addition to that, the aftermath of the 2011 famine, Dobley town became home to hundreds of desperate people with 45% of the population are malnourished children. Cramped in makeshift shelters under the bare branches of acacia trees, they came from all over southern Somalia – by foot and donkey cart – to try and cross the border into Kenya. Some walked for two weeks to get there and nearly a thousand people arrived on a daily basis, all of them virtually without anything to eat.</p>
            <p>Families cooked on small fires and a single mango was usually shared between two or three children. The majority of the populations were farmers whose crops died after a year without rain. Others were pastoralists whose animals perished. The situation was dire as the entire population faced a terrible human catastrophe unless immediate intervention was deployed.  </p>

            <p>Islamic Help Tanzania agreed on a joint intervention in Somalia with Somali Relief and Development Forum (SRDF). Islamic Help Tanzania responded through deploying food convoys leading 125MT food aid and raising considerable awareness about the conditions in Somalia paving the way for a community owned response from Tanzanians to the people of Somalia displaying African unity and solidarity. </p>
