            <h1>Somalia Droughts 2011</h1>
            <img src='images/slides/somaliaa/somalia_photo2.jpg' alt='' width="695"/>
            <p>Dobley is a border town of Afmadow district, Southern Somalia. The district has an estimated population of 50,000 to 100,000 households and has one of the highest poverty levels with an index of 60 percent. In 2011, Dobley Town was under control by TFG forces that were visible with loaded heavy machinery. The town had one general hospital that was not functioning suitably with limited supplies of medicine; only MCH was active. The town consisted of several mosques and schools then empty and derelict buildings. The district was an arid one, with an average rainfall of less than 200 mm per year. The rainfall was erratic making the entire district susceptible to draught. The deadly combination of livestock diseases, Rift Valley Fever, and persistent draught killed tens of hundreds of livestock herds in 2011 eliminating the mainstay of the bulk of the population. This subsequently caused a massive movement of nomads into towns without any source of income. </p>

            <p>In addition, Dobley town became home to hundreds of desperate people where 45% of the population were malnourished children. Cramped in makeshift shelters under bare branches of acacia trees, migrants came by foot and donkey carts from all over Southern Somalia to try and cross the border into Kenya. Some walked for two weeks to get there and nearly a thousand people arrived on a daily basis, all of them without anything to eat.</p>
            <p>Families cooked on small fires and single mangos were commonly shared between two or three children. The majority of the populations were farmers whose crops died after a year without rain. Others were pastoralists whose animals perished. The situation was dire as the entire population faced a terrible human catastrophe unless immediate intervention was deployed.   </p>

            <p>Islamic Help Tanzania agreed on a joint intervention in Somalia with Somali Relief and Development Forum (SRDF), Programme on Life Emergency (POLE) and various local organisations. The joint intervention responded through deploying a convoy of three trucks carrying 125MT of food aid and other items such as wheat, flour, rice, maize, dates, sugar and nutritional supplements. In addition, Islamic Help Tanzania raised considerable awareness about the conditions in Somalia paving the way for a community owned response from Tanzanians to the people of Somalia displaying African unity and solidarity.  </p>
