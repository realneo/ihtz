            <p>The backbone of any civilization is its human resources. A nation which invests in educating and training its population will pave the way to prosperity and better quality of life. A nation that cares for its female population and ensures that they have an excellent upbringing will create a positive ripple effect in generations to come.</p>
            <p>Tanzania is one of the fast growing economies of Africa. Dar es Salaam the commercial capital of Tanzania is one of the fastest growing cities in East Africa. The Government of Tanzania invests a considerable portion on education and training its population.&nbsp; Private international schools play a vital role in providing quality education especially among high income families in Tanzania. However among the Muslim population in Tanzania there is a mixed feeling about international schools. Many Muslim girls who attend international schools are deprived of further education as most secondary schools lack gender segregation which is an integral part of the Islamic culture.&nbsp;</p>

Arabic language will also be included as a compulsory subject as it opens gateways to endless opportunities in learning &amp; understanding more of the religion of Islam.</p>

            <h2>Fee structure</h2>
