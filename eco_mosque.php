            <h1>Eco Mosque</h1>
            <p>One of the outstanding features of Islamic Help's Eco Village is the Eco Mosque, believed to be the first of its type in Africa.</p>
            <img src="images/slides/eco_mosque/eco_mosque_00_med.jpg" alt="" width="690">
            <p>The first foundation stone of the Eco Mosque was laid in March 2012. The structure was strategically built on high ground allowing the flow of wind, sunlight and water collection so as to create an efficient building system using green technologies, including solar power, and ensuring efficient energy management.</p>
            <p>The Eco Mosque can accommodate a congregation of up to 160 people and the first prayers were held in Ramadan 2012.</p>

            <p>The main features of the Eco Mosque are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="red">Less noise pollution</span> - the design of the mosque has eliminated the need for a microphone as the architects have created a natural echo in the prayer hall</li>
                <li><span class="red">Natural ventilation</span> - the large windows and ventilation allow enough light and air to circulate through the mosque, reducing the need for electrical fans</li>
                <li><span class="red">Solar energy</span> - solar energy is used for lights, fans and motors for water pumps.</li>
                <li><span class="red">Rain water harvesting</span> - there are three water collection tanks with a capacity to hold 2,000 litres each. Over the course of a year it is estimated that the tanks will collect approximately 95,800 litres of water. The water will be used for wudu (ablution) and washing</li>
                <li><span class="red">Re-use of Wudu water</span> - water management is an often overlooked component in most construction projects. If, on average one person uses about 1.5 litres of water when making wudu from the mosque, a total of 225 litres will be used per day. The waste water from the mosque is taken directly to the gardens and is re-used to irrigate a fruit and vegetable garden consisting of bananas and pumpkins.</li>
            </ul>
