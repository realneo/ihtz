            <h1>About us</h1>
            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>Islamic Help is a UK registered charity and international NGO established in 2003 by a group of young people determined to make a difference to the lives of those afflicted by poverty and suffering.
               Enthusiastic, dedicated and visionary the group took their ideas to older and wiser members of the community and were pleased to get their support and to launch an initiative that a few years later would become the globally recognised charity that is Islamic Help. It now works in over 20 countries, Tanzania being one of the many.</p> 
            
            <p>Islamic Help started working in Tanzania from 2009 mainly in Mafia Island with two projects “Mission to Mafia”. Since then, Islamic help has implemented livelihood, education, water and sanitation, health and good governance projects in Tanzania. </p>
