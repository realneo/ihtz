                        <h3>Home</h3>
                        <p>In March 2012, Islamic Help started an exciting and innovative 3-year building project in Tanzania to support 160 orphans and vulnerable children, create jobs and livelihoods for communities and establish a legacy of sustainability and development.</p>
                        <p>Set in 30 acres of lush green surroundings just outside the capital Dar es Salam, our Eco Village – when completed - will feature 16 homes, a sports ground, a playground, an Eco Mosque, a community centre, a library, a training centre and a permaculture farm.</p>
                        <p>The Eco Mosque, believed to be the first of its kind in Africa, was completed in July 2012 and in August 2013 the first of the children’s homes was opened, while the farm has started producing crops and contributing to the biodiversity of the area.</p>
                        <p>The Children's Eco Village is located in the Mkurunga district south of Dar es Salaam, close to the small town of Kisemvule which consists of about 20 shops, a mosque and surrounding houses. A local secondary school, Vikindu School, is situated between Kisemvule and the Eco Village.</p>
                        <p>Islamic Help has been working in Tanzania since 2007 with life-changing initiatives and focusing on sustainable development including orphan care and sponsorships, livelihood and income generation. With its emphasis on sustainability and almost total reliance on green energy, our pioneering Eco Village is another innovative addition to that philosophy.</p>

                        <p>The Village will include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>16 homes for 160 vulnerable children</li>
                            <li>Accommodation for their professional carers</li>
                            <li>General manager’s family quarters</li>
                            <li>Administrative block </li>
                            <li>2 staff family quarters </li>
                            <li>Sports ground </li>
                            <li>Children’s play area</li>
                            <li>Eco mosque</li>
                            <li>Community centre</li>
                            <li>Library</li>
                            
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Children's Homes</h3>
                        <p>In Tanzania, orphans traditionally have been cared for by close relatives and neighbours. In recent years however socio-economic changes, the prevalence of HIV, urbanisation and other issues have resulted in increasing numbers being placed in orphanages. For many of them, it means living in inadequate conditions with unqualified guardians and a lack of education and welfare.</p>
                        <img src='images/slides/ecovillage/eco_village_childrens_homes_00_med.jpg' alt='' />
                        <p>Islamic Help has been working in Tanzania since 2009 for the sustainable development of communities through education, orphan care and sponsorships, support in water & sanitation, livelihood & income generation, environmental awareness and women’s empowerment.</p>
                        <p>We were already caring for about 400 orphans through the generosity of sponsors and had a working model with 25 orphans in an orphanage in Mbagala before embarking on our innovative Children’s Eco Village.</p>
                        <p>It aims to provide a homely environment designed to nurture the physical, mental, psychological and emotional growth of vulnerable children, through holistic community-based care which helps them develop into socially and environmentally aware adults.</p>

                        <p>Each of the 16 spacious homes will accommodate 10 children along with a professional carer. This ‘mother’ will live with the children, building a close relationship with every child entrusted to her and providing the security, love and stability each of them needs. In this environment, the youngsters will enjoy a real sense of security and belonging, growing up and learning together, sharing responsibilities and all the joys and challenges of daily life.</p>
                        <p>Each house will have three bedrooms, a kitchen, bathroom/toilets, dining area and living room. The buildings and structures are designed to be highly energy efficient and the adoption of green energy technologies, including waste management, recycling and bio-gas, will ensure a clean, green and productive environment.</p>

                        <p>For their physical development, the Eco Village will have a play area featuring an obstacle course and a multi-purpose sports ground which will also be a valuable resource for others in the area.

                        <h3>Permaculture Farming</h3>
                        <p>Permaculture farming is a means by which farming can be made much more efficient and ecologically friendly. It uses natural principles in the farming process instead of man-made, potentially destructive methods that could harm the earth. In the current climate where population density is rapidly increasing and natural resources are becoming limited, permaculture farming can provide sustainable living and ecological food production.</p>
                        <p>It focuses on design, creating well-thought out and intelligent plans for sustainable systems that are in harmony with nature. It maintains agriculturally productive eco-systems that allow people to benefit in a sustainable and ethical way.</p>
                        <img src='images/slides/ecovillage/eco_village_farming_01.jpg' alt='' width='225'/>

                        <img src='images/slides/ecovillage/eco_village_farming_03.jpg' alt='' width='225'/>
                        <p>The eco village operates with the vision of giving back more energy and materials to the community than they consume. It was with these considerations in mind that Islamic Help integrated permaculture farming into the overall plans.</p>
                        <p>The farm will create jobs for local people who will be trained to adopt permaculture practices and continuously regenerate and conserve the biodiversity of the area. The produce grown on the farm will be consumed by the residents of the eco village and sold in the local market to generate further income. </p>

                        <img src='images/slides/ecovillage/eco_village_farming_06.jpg' alt='' width='225'/>
                        <p>Features of the farm include:</p> 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Vegetable gardens</li>
                            <li>Rearing of livestock including chickens, goats and cows</li>
                            <li>Bee hives</li>
                            <li>Seasonal crops such as maize, ground nuts</li>
                            <li>Farm quarters, store & office</li>
                            <li>A pond with fish and ducks</li>
                        </ul>
                        <img src='images/slides/ecovillage/eco_village_farming_07.jpg' alt='' width='160'/>

                        <p>The village is already reaping rewards from the farm - the first harvest yielded aubergines, okra, green chillies, tomatoes and Chinese cabbage. The methods and practices adopted by the farmers means increased yields and income all year round which results in improved living standards for the eco village members and farmers.</p>
                        <p>It is not just produce that generates income. The farmhouse will be rented out as a ‘getaway’ retreat for urban visitors and families, and used to encourage urban-dwelling children’s education of farming. </p>

                        <h3>Water</h3>
                        <p>The village requires a minimum of 5,000 litres of water every day for drinking and washing, plus additional 4,000-5,000 litres for livestock, farming and gardening purposes, needs that will be met by two 80-metre boreholes.</p>

                        <p>The Eco Village estate boasts a forest reserve and natural underground springs. Adopting permaculture principles, a number of naturally spring-fed ponds will be created to increase the bio diversity of the area and support abundant wildlife including fish, ducks and geese. Fish will be farmed as a means of generating income.</p>
                        <p>Swales, as used in permaculture design, will also capture run off rainwater from the ground and direct it toward the numerous ponds, while ‘grey water’ – from kitchens and showers – will be directed towards smaller ponds near the buildings.</p>
                        <img src='images/slides/water/eco_village_water_04.jpg' alt='' width='225'/>

                        <p>Furthermore, a natural swimming pool will also be created at the rear end of the ponds for children and adults to swim in.</p>
                        <p>Among the objectives is:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Training the orphans fish farming to earn extra income</li>
                            <li>Providing an income source for the Eco Village</li>
                            <li>Learning about biodiversity</li>
                            <li>Recreation in a natural environment</li>
                            <li>A working model for the region to come out of poverty</li>
                            
                        </ul>
