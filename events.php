                                        <h3>Environmental Seminar - Moshi 2013</h3>
                                        <p>As part of Islamic Help Tanzania’s Trees for Change campaign, the team conducted a full day workshop, their first Environmental Seminar in Moshi town; a small town located on the slopes of Mt Kilimanjaro, a dormant volcano that is the highest mountain in Africa. Although the vibrant atmosphere of the town and remarkable landscapes attract thousands of tourists every year, food insecurity and degrading water sources is a growing concern for the population.  
                                        <p>As a first environmental activity of the work programme, this event was really important. Islamic Help Tanzania invited major stakeholders of the community such as, the Interfaith Group, Ministry of Land and Natural Resources, Forestry Commission and Park Rangers to kick-start their Tree’s for Change campaign in the Kilimanjaro region. The work-shop was not only an opportunity meet, exchange ideas and share experiences. The meeting was meant as a seminar with variety workshops on Environmental Sustainability, the main concepts, effects and reasons for deforestation. What is more, participants were introduced to Islamic Help’s initiative of reducing the trend of deforestation, which was widely taken and positively received.

                                        <p>&lsquo;The Eco-Village that Islamic Help is building just outside Dar es Salam is an innovative and ground breaking project that will provide security and stability to the most vulnerable in our society.This is an exciting venture and I applaud Islamic Help for its foresight and vision. Inshallah it will be a model village for others to emulate. I am hopeful that all of us here can make this village happen, make it a reality and make a contribution to the future prosperity of this city, this nation and above all to the future of countless orphans that stand to benefit&rsquo;.</p>
                                        <p>The dinner raised 112,000,000 Tshs.</p>
