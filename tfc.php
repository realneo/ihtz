                        <br />
                        <p>The need to care for our environment is not a modern phenomenon. It permeates through the Qur'an and Hadith, and Islam warns us not to gorge and waste but to care for and enrich our planet. It is one of the driving forces of Islamic Help's desire to improve the lives of the impoverished and needy. Not only do we provide direct aid but we help them make the best use of their natural resources and replenish their environment.</p>
                        <p>Among those natural resources are trees, an essential component for life on Earth. At the most basic level, they absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen. Without them, there is no oxygen and no life. So planting, nourishing and cherishing the growth of trees is not just about providing shade and landscape, it is about sustaining life.</p>
                        <img src='images/tfc/trees_for_change_00.jpg' alt='' width="695"/>
                        <p>They are also crucial in increasing water resources and providing clean water for drinking. They play a major role in the process of transpiration (evaporation of water through a plant and its evaporation) which increases the chances of much-needed rain in regions of the world.</p>
                        <p>As well as providing nutrients to the soil, so that the earth is replenished and becomes fertile, trees control soil erosion and so help improve water quality, while also preventing flooding. Their ecosystems help wildlife and insects survive and prosper, and every day mankind uses an array of materials from trees, from food and drink to wood, rubber and medicines.</p>

                        <img src='images/tfc/trees_for_change_03.jpg' alt='' width="340"/>
                        <p>Overuse and destruction of this rich natural resource threatens the fragile balance which allows life to flourish. The World Resources Institute estimates that only about a fifth of the world's original forest cover remains "intact" and while forests today cover more than a quarter of the world's total land area, they are being rapidly destroyed for agriculture, mining and urbanisation.</p>
                        <p>In Tanzania, deforestation is proceeding at an estimated average annual rate of 0.5%, lower than many other African countries but still substantial in relation to the resources available in Tanzania and with potentially devastating consequences. It is why Islamic Help has dedicated itself to redressing some of the imbalance through our Trees for Change programme.</p>

                        <br />
                        <p>Increasing charcoal and timber production, inefficient use of land for agriculture, mining and expansion of human habitation are among the primary causes for deforestation in Tanzania. Inevitably this has led to receding ground water levels, vulnerability to food insecurity, land degradation and, in the bigger picture, the effects of climate change.
                        <p>To combat some of these, Islamic Help Tanzania has launched a major tree planting campaign, Trees for Change. About 30,000 trees of different species, including fruit trees, will be planted and distributed in villages.
                        <p>In the long term, it will not only offset the effects of deforestation and climate change but also allow communities to nurture their own nurseries, earn livelihoods, learn agricultural techniques and even improve soil quality and the purity of water sources.

                        <p>Trees for Change aims to:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Create a sustainable environmental regeneration action plan in 30 villages</li>
                            <li>Plant and nurture 30,000 trees in the selected villages and surroundings</li>
                            <li>Increase additional family income for, initially, at least 150 families in the selected target area.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <img src='images/tfc/plant_nursery_01.jpg' alt='' width="340"/>
                        <img src='images/tfc/plant_nursery_02.jpg' alt='' width="340"/>
                        <p>The main project locations are in coastal areas which are suffering from, and deemed to be highly vulnerable to, the effects of climate change. The 30 villages are in Pangani, Kisarawe, Mukuranga, Kilwa, Rugiji and Temeke districts, and an estimated population of more than 26,000 benefit directly from Trees for Change.</p>
                        <p>As part of the programme, local plant nurseries are being established in the villages to be managed mainly by local women's groups for income generation. For example, a group may grow 1,000-2,000 plants in their nursery for about six months and sell them back to Trees for Change, earning them about Â£400 every six months.<p>

                        <img src='images/tfc/trees_for_change_02.jpg' alt='' width="230"/>
                        <p>These will include large fruit trees, such as mangoes and avocado, but the variety will vary depending on the needs of the local communities and will also be sold on an individual basis. The first of these nurseries has already been established with 2,000 plants at our Eco Village in Mukuranga district.</p>
                        <p>As well as the practical benefits, Trees for Change is a model for raising awareness in Tanzania and a blueprint for other other areas, particularly in Africa, for best practice in environmental regeneration.</p>

                        <p>If 2013 was a landmark year with Islamic Help UK's 10th anniversary, 2014 promises to be a world record-breaker for Islamic Help.</p>
                        <p>We have embarked on one of our most ambitious projects ever - most trees planted in one hour, a feat that will earn us a place among the Guinness World Records title-holders. The current record (set in April 2012) is 40,885 trees planted by 100 people in 1 hour in India*.</p>
                        <p>The aim of the initiative is to highlight the impact trees and the environment have on the quality of life and poverty.</p>
                        <img src='images/tfc/mount_kilimanjaro_med.jpg' alt='' width='690' />
                        <p>After surveying a number of locations in Tanzania, Islamic Help has set itself the challenge of planting 50,000 trees at the foot of Mt. Kilmanjaro. This is where the biggest impact of global warming is felt, where the largest carbon footprint is created (due tourism) and is also a high profile area to raise awareness of the campaign.</p>
                        <p>The project will not just be to plant trees but will involve 6 months of detailed awareness workshops and training for the people of the area and creating action plans on their responsibilities in this cause.</p>
                        <p>Details of the challenge are being finalised but it has already received the backing of government officials, local NGOs, inter-faith leaders and other stakeholders who have all officially given their support to Islamic Help.</p>
