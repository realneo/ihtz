            <h1>Trees For Change</h1>
            <img src='images/slides/nursery/1.jpg' alt='' width="695"/>
            <p>Tanzania is one of the many countries suffering from deforestation at an alarming pace. The combined forces of climate change, population growth and environmental degradation threaten the livelihoods and well-being of 80 per cent of Tanzania’s population. Statistics display in 1990 Tanzania had a forest cover of 49,450,000 hectares however the current total forest cover is 35,257,000 hectares which is a 29% decrease in merely 23 years. If deforestation continues at the current rate Tanzania could potentially lose its entire forest in less than a century.</p> 
            <p>At current rates we risk the permanent loss of these forests and the valuable benefits they provide such as food security, nutrition, animals, tourism and history.</p>
            <p>Community inaction seems to be the foremost hurdle in preventing deforestation. Increased awareness on environment at community level with proactive action plans to prevent or rather manage deforestation can be a way forward to minimize this trend. Islamic Help have therefore introduced the Tree’s for Change project:</p>
            <p>As part of the Tree’s for Change project Islamic Help have currently established a sustainable supply of tree’s through their very own nursery of 60,000 seedlings currently in the Children’s Eco Village, In addition, Islamic Help project reaching a nursery of 250,000 seedlings by Dec 2014. </p>

            <h3>Selecting Tree Plantation Areas: </h3>
            <p>The project intends to conduct CPAs (community participatory appraisals) in selected vulnerable areas to identify locations for Agro forests (possible reforestation areas), community compounds, and roads to plant trees. The locations are chosen based on their vulnerability but with minimum risk conditions such as availability of water. When the locations are ear marked the surrounding communities are mobilized to start plant nurseries, engage in awareness workshops (schools, mosques etc) and form an action committee. They will liaise with the local village councils to ensure smooth delivery of the project.</p>
            <p>So far Islamic Help have identified agro forestry (food forests) as a major focus of tree planting. However other innovative ideas are also explored such as developing school gardens and mosque gardens. It is envisaged that when communities realise the economic impact of the project along with its environmental and Spiritual elements the impact will be greater in the years to come.</p>

            <h3>Plantation of Trees:</h3>
            <p>To date, Islamic Help have planted a total of 1,500 trees around different areas of Dar es Salaam such as, Kisarawe, Mkuranga and 700 trees at the Children’s Eco Village. The Tree’s for change team further project reaching a total of 100,000 trees planted by December 2014.</p>
            <p>Community groups (youth groups, schools) are assigned to look after the trees and ensure they are healthy and growing. In some cases they will are paid to water the plants for a required period of time. In other instances simple irrigation methods (improvised drip irrigation) are used to ensure the well- being of the plant. Also there will be a community reward system for the best sub project or location. </p>
            <p>In order to sustain the trees (5 -10% trees may die) the project ensures extra supply of trees to replace any dead trees within a period of 1 year (generally the trees are not vulnerable after 1 year). 
            <p>The cost of planting a tree is currently 10,000 Tsh. This includes: Planting the tree, assigning a name plaque, sending donor feedback and reports, and sustaining the tree until maturity. Moreover a small portion of the donation (for a tree) will be used for awareness and community mobilizing. This will include awareness provision of low energy cooking stoves (reducing charcoal), home gardening, permaculture training, developing community action plans etc. </p>
            <p>Islamic Help provides donor feedback for each tree which will include the photo of the tree with the sign board, GPS code of the location, location details and type of tree*
