                    <h3>Mission Possible</h3>
                    <p>Mission Possible is a UK based expedition which gives volunteers a full spectrum of the humanitarian aid delivery process and involves campaigning, fundraising and a deployment in Tanzania of up to 10 days. 
                    <p>Mission Possible takes volunteers from the United Kingdom on a journey from fundraising and meeting many like-minded individuals to actually distributing aid in Tanzania and to see first-hand exactly how much of a difference a donation makes to a person’s life. Volunteers begin the project fundraising and carrying out activities like street collections, sponsored events, walks, bike rides, mountain climbs, charity dinners and family fun days in order to raise funds for the cause allocated to them by Islamic Help. 
                    <p>They then plan and deliver the aid themselves during a 7-10 day overseas deployment. Volunteers are supported in planning and delivering aid by our Islamic Help in Dar Es Salaam.

                    <h3>Projects</h3>
                    <p>Mission Possible volunteers have the opportunity to be involved in a number of projects including:</p>
                    <h3>Supporting Schools</h3>
                    <p>Volunteers provide support to schools and assist with teaching. They also distribute equipment to the schools they work in.</p>
                    <h3>Supporting Orphanages</h3>
                    <p>Volunteers visit and support our orphanages and orphan projects. They get the opportunity to meet with orphans that we sponsor under our Worldwide Orphan Sponsorship Scheme. We also try to ensure that our volunteers get to organise a fun day with the orphans, either at the orphanage or at a local attraction like a zoo. In addition equipment and resources are also provided by the volunteers to the orphanages.</p>
                    <h3>Malaria Prevention</h3>
                    <p>Malaria remains a big killer in the developing world. As part of Mission Possible we carry out a Malaria prevention awareness campaign which includes leaflet distribution and workshops. In addition we also distribute mosquito nets.</p>
                    <h3>Livelihood Projects</h3>
                    <p>Income generation is a real challenge for many in the developing world. In supporting people out of poverty we provide opportunities for setting up small businesses. Our Mission Possible volunteers have the opportunity of assisting in this and in identifying viable opportunities and helping to establish the actual enterprises.</p>
                    <h3>Community Awareness Projects</h3>
                    <p>We have a number of initiatives that seek to increase awareness of certain issues and to assist in tackling those issues. Our Mission Possible volunteers assist in the delivery of some of the awareness seminars and programmes that we run.</p>
                    <h3>Water Solutions</h3>
                    <p>Water scarcity is a real problem and over 1 billion people still lack access to clean water and 2.5 billion lack adequate sanitation. We build water pumps, wells and other solutions to water scarcity including rain water harvesting systems. Our Mission Possible volunteers have the opportunity of being involved in these projects.</p>
                    <h3>Environmentally Sustainable Projects</h3>
                    <p>Sustainability is key to any solutions that we provide to poverty, disadvantage and hunger. We seek to ensure that the solution we provide has long term benefits and is sustainable and eco-friendly. Our volunteers are involved in the discussions on this and in the projects that we run.</p>
                    <h3>Health Programmes</h3>
                    <p>In addition to Malaria prevention initiatives we also have others initiatives that assist in the improvement of health and hygiene so as to minimise the exposure to disease. Our volunteers assist in the delivery of such programmes of awareness.</p>
