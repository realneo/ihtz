                       <p>In Tanzania it is estimated that women especially in rural areas provide 80% of the labour force in farming and producing 60% of food production. Poverty and disempowerment go hand-in-hand; as poverty reduces, empowerment increases. In 2012 Islamic Help initiated the ‘Wezesha Maisha’ project, a livelihood project for women in economic poor and vulnerable communities. The project seeks to achieve empowerment by providing training in management and entrepreneurship.  Post training, Islamic Help provides the selected groups with interest-free loans that aim to create economic opportunities for not only the beneficiaries but also the community. </p>
                       <h3>Wezesha Maisha Objectives:</h3>
                       <ol>
                           <li>Increasing income of the economic poor through the undertaking of small scale income generating projects with interest free loans.</li>
                           <li>Create the sense of belonging and responsibility and help beneficiaries through the projects to be able to educate their children and the community.</li>
                           <li>Empower the beneficiaries to manage their financial responsibility.</li>
                           <li>Empowering and building the communities socially by supporting them through the livelihood projects.</li>
                           <li>Train more people with basic business/project management tools.</li>
                       </ol>

                       <p>To-date 334 individuals (from 3 Districts of Dar es Salaam, Tabata-Chang’ombe, Kigamboni and Keko), have been trained on entrepreneurship and Islamic business ethics (296 women and 38 men). The demand for the same by other groups is high, an indicator that the project is a life changing program. The training motivates the beneficiaries to engage in business and enterprises and becomes a simple tool for developing business plans and a reason to source and apply for a loan from Islamic Help. A fee of 1500Tshs ($1 or £0.5) is paid by each individual for the two (2) days training (Islamic Help provides meals, stationary, costs of travel for the trainers, equipment cost etc).</p> 

                        <p>Once completed the beneficiaries are grouped and the preparation for a business plan thus starts whereby they  raise and submit their plan/proposal to Islamic Help project appraisal desk for approval for which funds are given as “Qardha-al-hassan” Loan and Grants. Follow up and repayment process is done after the disbursement of fund and delivery of project according to terms and the nature of the project.</p>

                        <p>Using an economic entry point has not only resulted in an economic change in the lives of the beneficiaries but has also prompted social change. The training sessions and business ventures have given women more self-confidence and a greater feeling of hope in managing their families. For instance, women’s control over their projects and direct contribution to household income has resulted in women having a greater say in household decisions such as, how money should be saved and spent.  Perhaps the most important change is the empowerment of individual women which is starting to manifest through improved self-esteem, a more secure livelihood and a greater sense of hope for what the future holds. </p>

                        <h1>Trend project</h1>
                        <p>Tanzania Rural Enterprises Network for Development (TREND) is yet another project aimed at empowering the economic poor through promotion of &ldquo;fair trade&rdquo;. The aim of TREND is to support subsistence farmers by ensuring that they receive a better market share and bargain for their products. This project will also help the community to improve the quality of their product and scale up their methods of farming, producing, packaging and delivery. Pilot projects have currently been launched for products such as honey and intend to unveil sesame seeds and sunflower within the near future.</p>
                        <h2>Beekeeping</h3>
                        <p>Tanzania only produces 9000MT of its capacity of 138000 MTs of bee honey production. The global demand has increased by 10% to a staggering 154 million MT per year by 2010. The value of honey has also increased by 30% over the last 3 years as honey production in Europe is declining. Hence African honey has a brighter future.<br /> <br /> The Eco Village situated in Mukuranga district around 50 km from the capital Dar es Salaam is surrounded by lush green landscape and has a large potential for beekeeping. However as many areas of Tanzania it is considered a novel idea and hence many have not explored its potential. The farmers who are keeping bees lack appropriate technology to increase their production and to ensure appropriate quality for export.<br /> <br /> Understanding this lack of supply and high demand Islamic Help Tanzania intends to set up a modern intensive beekeeping project in its Eco Village farm. The investment is <span class="red">13,000,000 Tshs</span>. The investor/ donor can be a partner or can contribute as cash Waqf which will give regular income for supporting the orphan children in the eco village</p>

                        <p>Islamic Help Tanzania&rsquo;s main aim is to supply quality bulk honey to the UK and Middle East. Islamic Help have been registered as an exporter and are now seeking potential buyers on internet portals as well as forums. Islamic Help have also linked with Honey king a Chinese venture to supply honey in case of over production and have built rapport with the Ministry for Natural resources to start a network with local beekeepers in Kilwa, Kisarawe , Mukuranga and Pangani. Islamic Help hope to set up similar projects within these districts and also purchase from local beekeepers; expecting&nbsp; a of supply 10MTs by 2017</p>
