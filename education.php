            <h1>Education & Training</h1>
            
            <h2>Educational Seminars:</h2>
            <p>The United Republic of Tanzania believes quality education is the pillar of national development, for it is through education that the nation obtains skilled manpower to serve in various sector in the nationâ€™s economy.  It is through quality education Tanzania will be able to create a strong and competitive economy which can effectively cope with the challenges of development and which can also easily and confidently adapt to the changing market and technological conditions and global economy in the region.</p>
            <p>Similarly, Islamic Help Tanzania believes education must keep pace with the rapid globalisation of our society over the last few decades in order to break the cycle of poverty that so many are ensnared in. Through educational seminars Islamic Help aim to create awareness, understanding and knowledge of challenges such as, climate change, epidemic diseases, empowerment, entrepreneurship and many other global challenges.Islamic Help Tanzania currently operates in a number of regions to provide support to those that struggle to access educational opportunities.</p>
            <p>We ensure that every child that we sponsor under our Orphan Sponsorship Scheme is given access to schooling and to everything necessary to progress their education. Furthermore, every year hundreds of students are supported by Islamic Help as part of Mission Possible in Tanzania. Students are provided with school bags, books, stationery and are even taught by volunteers.</p>

            <h2>Orphan Donor Forum </h2>
            <p>The problem of orphans and other vulnerable children is not new in Tanzania. Orphans and other vulnerable children were all taken care of, supported and protected by their close relatives and neighbours. When the number of orphans and other vulnerable children increased beyond the capacity of the community to handle, some of these children were taken to orphanages while others were taken by step parents and others were adopted. By 2005, 53% of orphans and other vulnerable children were being cared for by the elderly while 12% were living in child-headed households.</p>
            <p>However with changing global geo &ndash; political and economic scenarios, many Islamic communities are faced with enormous challenges even in caring of orphans. Escalating conflicts, HIV, high divorce rates, urbanization and many other issues contribute to this factor. This rapid increase has resulted in children being raised in orphanages as well.</p>
            <img src='images/slides/education/donor_forum_0.jpg' alt='' />
            <p>A recent survey conducted by TAQWA, concluded nearly 33% of the orphans living in orphanages in Dar es Salaam do not have a mother or father. Moreover 34% of the orphans in the orphanages are living in inadequate conditions with unqualified caretakers and not attending school paving a recipe of disaster for the future of the children.</p>
            <p>The best role model for an orphan is the Messenger (SAW), who was an orphan yet reached great heights in this life and hereafter. The character and personality of the prophet was nurtured by his upbringing through his surrogate family and extended family. Al Quran supports this model mentioning &lsquo;Have you seen him who denies Ad Din? That is he who repulses the orphan&rsquo; (Al ma&rsquo;un 1-2) indicating the community obligation while insisting to be just to them. The Islamic traditions upheld these values for centuries, making an obligation to support and sustain the growth of orphans.</p>
            <p>The Orphans Donor Forum is an initiative of Islamic Help and TAQWA to build synergy with other like minded organizations and individuals in providing quality support for the orphans of Tanzania.</p>
            <h3>Objectives:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>To share best practices of orphan care in Tanzania</li>
                <li>To understand challenges in delivering quality service to the orphans</li>
                <li>To build synergy and partnerships</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Workshop on Islamic Environment Ethics:</h2>
            <p>Islamic Help a long with IFEES (Islamic Foundation for Environmental Sciences) put together a 2-day workshop on Islamic environmental ethics. The workshop focussed on the creation and conservation of the environment based on the Quran and Islamic teachings. Along with this, the workshop elaborated more on an Islamic approach to conservation based on: Islamic Ethics on Unity (Tawhid), Natural state (Fitra), Balance (Mizan) and responsibility (khalifa). Shariah encourages practices such as Hema &ndash; Conservations zones, Al Harim &ndash; Inviolable zone, Iqta &ndash; Land grants and Ijara - Land leased.</p>
